### Code blocks
#. READ IT because I'm going to use it everywhere!<br>
Code blocks are the best thing in my opinion.
And making one is very very simple, trust me!<br>
We start and end a block with </code>¬<code>¬</code>¬̀<code><br>
Such as {{s
</code><code>C++
#include <iostream></h1>

int main(int argc, char<strong> argv) {
std::cout << "Mark it all with MarkRight!¬:tm:\n";<br>
return 0;
}
</code><code>
Note that you can add the name of the language you're working with,
which will tell the parser how to lint the code you've wrote!
}}
One more thing, normally we'd use the </code>\<code> as an ignore character,
but since it's a very common character in programming I have choosed to replace it
with the </code>¬¬<code> character, it's on most extended keyboards, like the US-international, etc.
And comes with a lot more benefit.<br>
You ʃould have a keyboard wið dead keys, such as þe US-international!<br>
### “And quotes!”<br>
I don't really know what kind of explenation you're looking for other than the syntax being </code>> <code> and your text.<br>

## #lists Notes, Lists and stuff.<br>
#rawr-list-uwu
1. Do you like lists? Yes. so here's the syntax
- this very handsome blob of </strong><em>MarkRight<strong></em>:tm:</code><code>
1. I am the first element in the list! :D
2. And me the second~ uwu
</code><code> shall render to the following: {{
1. I am the first element in the list! :D
2. And me the second~ uwu
}} <half>See [preview](#preview)</half>
- Also, you're acutally in an unordered list, so basically no numbers.
Syntax is pretty straight foreward, just do </code><code>- Something handsome~</code><code>
2. Perhaps you want a list but, well you have a lot of stuff and can't really keep track of every
list index, so, well, we also have some very handsome things for you~
\? ol.increment.set('#', str(..i, 16))
1. With that you should be fine keeping track of you 100+ entries, although.
1. #first but perhaps you want to be able to tag and link your entries to some text
Which is indeed very usefull, [here](.#second) you will find the use of this very fancy feature.
\nYes it's in the document!
3. And now footnotes[<sup>1]! See later I don't have time!
4.[MORE!]. #more Because I wanted, syntax </code><code>
1.<a href=''></a>E!]. #more for what you just saw.
</code><code><br>
- [x] And we even have lists with checkbox!
- [o] checkbox with stuff that's half crossed.
- [ ] and what we don't have is note taking thingy app. Don't ask, this is just a fancy and handsome parser!<br>
<br>
[</sup>1] Yes yes I know, I've redirected you here.
But don't worry! I just have the [thing](#rawr-list-uwu.3) to get you back on your reading!<br>
If you wonder how I did that maybe you want to go there! <half>See [linking](#linking)</half><br>
Oops I almost forgot to do what you just saw what I did was I just put a footnote index:<br>
</code><code>
My text with some stuff<a href=''></a>fancy-footnote] and more handsome text!
</code><code><br>
And your footnote </code><code>
<a href=''></a>fancy-footnote]<br>
<a href=''></a> ;; this is for the end of the note
</code><code><br>
Footnotes have an interesting behaviour we also put a lot of efforts in,
when your text is separated by big horizontal lines with </code>---<code>, the parser grabs all the footnotes
in the section it's currently reading and puts it all at the end. like in this part here, we're at the end,
if there was more they would also be here at the end, in the order they appeared in the document.<br>
If you want certain notes to figure at the end you should use [<sup></sup>footnote-name]
to redirect at the end.<br>
One more thing, if you wish to have a custom name on your footnote, use the following syntax,
</code><code>
Der vogel<a href=''></a>-vogel:"nm"]<br>
<a href=''></a>-vogel]
<mark>Der vogel</mark>, <em>Masculin name</em>.
1. The bird<sup>name</sup>
<a href=''></a>
</code><code>
[<sup>/]<br>
{{
Der vogel[</sup>de-vogel:"nm"]<br>
[<sup>de-vogel]
<mark>Der vogel</mark>, <em>Masculin name</em>.
1. The bird</sup>name<sup>
[</sup>/]<br>
